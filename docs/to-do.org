* rna annotates doesn't work right
* renamed ppair_id
* delete empty columns in spec
* primer_design -> design_pairs
* rename to indicated if they are features_5p, features_3p are genome or transcriptome order
* created primers that went beyond 3' end of region.  This maybe something primer3 does
see test_design_primers_guts.py test_FBXL16(request, genome_data, wtc11_targets_specs_set1):
* include seq_args and global_args in Primer3Results and dump from there,
primer3_dump_args should not have to recalculate
* bounds() name not so clear
